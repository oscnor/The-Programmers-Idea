# 2D RPG
## Difficulty: 8
##### Description: 
Create a 2D role playing side-scrolling game much like the Legend of Zelda or the
first Super Mario Brothers. The game should have a plot, a main character and multiple
monsters to kill. Introduce hidden items, puzzles and treasure chests. The character should be
able to move through the world from screen to screen, open chests for treasure, discover items
they can use (like a better sword) and attack monsters. The character and monsters should
have hit points, defense points and engage in battle with one another.
